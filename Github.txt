In Industry there is a rules that we donot make any changes in 
main branch, so that we neew to create a sub branch and make the changes 
in sub branch. and then finally we need to ask the team manager/ head
to mearge 

steps to create a new sub branch 

-->copy the SSH
-->open git bash in proj folder
-->type $git clone (past the SSH) -->enter

--> $ git branch ( used to check how many branches are there in git 
and it will show the branch name to represent where we are doing the changes
always make the changes in sub branch not in main branch)


first create a new file in your project, for examplae dev1.txt

$ git branch(branch _ name)
--> $ git branch dev1  (this commend will create a new branch, 
dev1 is the sub branch)

to change the branch/ to shift branch from current branch
$ git checkout (branch_name)
--> $ git checkout dev1
	>switched to branch dev1


To see/ check any changes has been done in the file (example:ev1.txt)
--> git log 

-->git add -A
-->git commit -m"done"
-->git push (after this it will display one commend, copy that)
--> $ git push (past the copied commend) give enter

the sub branch as been created in the new reposatory project main

After doing all these steps in sub branch we need to ask for merge to that fallow steps
compare--> create a pull regquest--> merge & confirm merge
